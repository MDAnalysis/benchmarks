# We now run all benchmarks since the last one run in this benchmarks repository. This assumes
# you have previously run at least ``asv run HEAD^!`` and added the results to the repository
# otherwise running ``asv run NEW`` will run all benchmarks since the start of the project.
# We add || true to make sure that if no commits are run (because there aren't any) things don't
# fail. But asv should have a way to return a zero status code in that case, so we should fix
# that in future. The timeout command is used to make sure that the command finishes before
# the next cron job - the timeout value is in seconds and can be adjusted.

# On Linux - using taskset -c 0 ensures that the same core is always used when running the benchmarks.
